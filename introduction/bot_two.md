# Messing With the Page

Now that we have have the page pulled and accessible, lets work on actually exploring it a bit in
order to see exactly what we are playing with here. If you step in and throw some `binding.pry`
statements around, you will easily be able to start playing with the reddit main page from here. 
Take a quick stab and look around. Try `page.forms`, `page.links`, `page.images`, or anything
that comes to mind. What we will first try to do is get the basic frontpage, 35 articles, and then
we will return it to the requester.
