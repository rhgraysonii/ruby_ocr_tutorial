# Strings and Numbers

## Introductoin
As mentioned in the intentions in the `README` I do not strive to reinvent the wheel when it comes
to solid, available resources.

[@michaelrkn](http://www.twitter.com/michaelrkn) is the maintainer of [Learn How To Program](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com)
and we will use his resources heavily for these beginning steps. He uses this and shares it freely as a resource for his
[Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com) programming bootcamp. I am a graduate of Epicodus in the past,
but am in no way afilliated with them officially. They just share great resources :)

Text and video lessons both are available, with cheat sheets if you find yourself stuck.
