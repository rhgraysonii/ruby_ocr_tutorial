# OCR and Ruby - A Love Story
# NOTE: This is a WIP

## Introduction
Hi, I'm Bobby. I recently wrote an [OCR Tutorial](http://www.github.com/rhgraysonii/ocr_tutorial) that was implemented using Python and Flask.
This was fun and dandy, but it was a very primitive implementation. In this short book, we're going
to dive into to a much more robust wrapper of tesseract-ocr, built by the prolific [Meh](http://www.github.com/meh).
