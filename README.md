# Ruby - A Curated Tour
#### NOTE: This is a WIP

## Intentions
I believe that anyone, anywhere, at any time should be able to learn how to program. I believe this because
I find it so fundamentally fulfilling that I base most of my life's non-sleeping activity on it. With this,
I dream of a resource that can effectively help someone slingshot their skills from x to y at any point in 
their experience, be it the day they learn how to code or ten years in and researching cutting-edge topics.

This book is an attempt to assemble such a resource. It will shamelessly link to other resources by others
in the community, for having a sole source of information is a fool's errand. If there is a better resource
I will link to it. if you know of it and I do not, send me a Pull Request. Even simple one liners are **MORE**
than welcomed.

It is currently in an infant state. It will be fluid, and much will change. I would not use this (yet). It
was birthed as a Ruby port of a Python OCR tutorial I did and I have since let it evolve. I believe at writing
the repository sits at close to 100 commits of code and writing already, and has been restructured massively
twice already.

## For who?
You, me, Dupree, and the universe, baby.

#### Note that for every chapter, there is an accompanying [shelr](link) cast that will be linked to. This shows you
the entirety of my terminal usage in the project, which for beginners can be very helpful.
