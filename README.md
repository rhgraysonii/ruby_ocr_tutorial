# Ruby - A Curated Tour
#### NOTE: This is a WIP

## Intentions
I am building this with one simple purpose:

#### Yet another resource to learn Ruby & Webdev
#### I am adding annotations via [Genius](http://www.genius.com/)

Why? Because its fun, and well, why not? 

The structure of this guide is simple. It begins assuming you know no Ruby. I will shamelessly proceed to link to other
resources that are quite reputable for the majority of the beginning tasks. 

### [Learn Ruby](/introduction/intro.md)


However, once you've a grasp on syntax, gems,
and maybe even running some tests, we will be able to move onto the wonderful part 1 of actual coding in this tutoral.

### [Building A Simple Bot](/introduction/bot.md)

From there, we take that bot, and wrap it as a very simple API class over reddit.com.

### [Wrapping A Web Service As an API](/introduction/bot_2.md)

Next, we turn it into a full blown RESTful API and expand functionality backed with a database.

### [Hooking In A Webserver - Sinatra](/introduction/sinatra.md)

And then we proceed to take this API, get a bunch of dank memes, and read the text from them.

### [OCR and Tesseract - Taking our webserver further](/tesseract/tess_1.md)

We drop in this OCR so we can read out dank memes.

### [Customizing OCR and Tesseract](/tesseract/tess_advanced.md.md)

And last but not least we bake in Ruby on Rails.

### [Baking in Rails](/rails/rails_1.md)

And there is a bonus chapter on deployment.

### [Deployment](/deploy/deployment.md)
